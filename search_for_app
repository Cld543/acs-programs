# This script prompts the user for the title of an app and then searches the 
# device to see if the app is installed
#
# This script was originally designed to be executed remotely on student devices to 
# periodically scan for any unapproved or dangerous apps. If you wish to send it remotely,
# uncomment the "APPNAME = "VLC" line and replace the string with whichever app you wish
# to search for. Then comment out the echo and read lines below it.
#
# By default, this script is designed to email the results of the scan to the users listed below.
# If extra users are to be added, simply add their emails to the end of the "mail" command, 
# separated by spaces if there are multiple addresses.

#/bin/bash
USER=`users`
# APPNAME = "VLC"
echo Enter the name of the app you want to search for: 
read APPNAME
